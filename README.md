# Inventory_Management_System
Our project is to design and implement an inventory management and reservation system for Bently Nevada, providing their employees a new interface to reserve and check-out equipment.
 
Bently Nevada employees currently have access to an inventory of outdoor gear that can be checked out for recreational use, however, their current software is unintuitive and outdated. Their existing equipment management system is broken, difficult to use, and incorrectly implemented. Our new, overhauled design of this software will feature a more structured database to track the current inventory and status of available equipment, allow for users to effortlessly rent equipment, and allow for system admins to monitor the current status of rental inventory. Furthermore, our design will promote a fresh user interface that better resembles that of Bently Nevadaâ€™s company-wide design philosophy, ultimately promoting a greater user experience for Bently employees and a more attractive employee benefit for potential new hires.
